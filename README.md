+ Project summary: 
	+ **Background** 
       
        This project mainly focused on implementing different versions of alternating least squares algorithm for collavorative filtering. This technique is used fo recommender systems: matching consumers with most appropriate products in order to enhance user satisfication and loyalty.
        The three versions of applying ALS are ALS with KNN , ALS with penalty of magnitudes and bias and intercept regularization an kNN, and the last one is  ALS with temporal regularizations and KNN. For evaluation, we compared RMSE results for different methods. Our group used R lanauage to product model and reports.
