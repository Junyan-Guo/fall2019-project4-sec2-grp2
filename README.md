+ Project summary: 
Project 4 Collaborative Filtering Algorithms Evaluation

In this project, working in teams, our group will implement, evaluate and compare algorithms for Collaborative Filtering.

Challenge

Collaborative filtering refers to the process of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).

For this project, our team is assigned specific algorithms from the Collaborative filtering literature. The aim of this project is to will study the algorithms carefully and implement them, from scratch. The details of the pairing assignment is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPcbGBv9hVOTXr1sYq_R7ze0qC25CkuB/view.
