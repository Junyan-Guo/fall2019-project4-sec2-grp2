+ Project summary: 
	+ **Background** 
	
        Recommender systems, a system mainly focus on matching consumers with most appropriate products in order to enhance user satisfication and loyalty, usually based on one of two strategies: The content filtering approach and the **_collaborative filtering_** method. The content filtering approach creates a profile for each user or product to characterize its nature, while collaborative filtering relies only on past user behavior—like ratings without requiring the creation of explicit profiles. The two primary areas of **_collaborative filtering_** are the neighborhood methods and **_latent factor models_**. Neighborhood methods are centered on computing the relationships between items or between users. **_latent factor models_** are an alternative approach that tries to explain the ratings by characterizing both items and users on, say, 20 to 100 factors inferred from the ratings patterns. Some of the most successful realizations of latent factor models are based on **_matrix factorization_** methods.


 	+ **Objective** 
	
        In this project, our group implement **_matrix factorization_** by focusing on different versions of alternating least squares algorithm for different Regularizations and KNN as Post-processing. The objective is to produce a good prediction of users’ preferences for movies on on the Netflix Prize dataset. For this project, our team #2 is assigned with [Pairing combination 9 + 11 + 13  from the Collaborative](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPcbGBv9hVOTXr1sYq_R7ze0qC25CkuB/view). For evaluation, we compared RMSE results for different methods. Our group used R lanauage to product model and reports. The specific technique used for the combination are illustrated below.

 	+ **Data** 

         Our Netfilx Prize dataset includes 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018. Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies.
